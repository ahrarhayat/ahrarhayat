Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
This is Ahrar Hayat, from Melbourne, Australia! I've graduated from Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Soon after graduation, I started working as a Software tester in my home country Bangladesh. After two years in the industry, I decided to switch my career path to a software developer and started my Masters program in Melbourne. I love to build applications and APIs in various platforms including Android, AWS, .NET MVC, and Microsoft Azure. Most of the applications that I've developed so far are related to IT for social good that helps people resolve a problem in their day to day lives.
