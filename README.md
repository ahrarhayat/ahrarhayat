Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
This is Ahrar Hayat, from Melbourne, Australia! I've graduated from Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Soon after graduation, I started working as a Software tester in my home country Bangladesh. After two years in the industry, I decided to be more involved with technology in my career and started my Masters program at Monash University, Melbourne. I develop applications and APIs in various platforms including React, Android, .NET MVC, automate tests using cypress and have experience with working with cloud platforms such as AWS, Microsoft Azure and am currently focussing on Front-End Development in react. I love building apps that people can use to make their quality of lives much better, and my goal is to play a part in contributing to technology everyday. I'm currently working as a QA Engineer in automation/Front-End Dev for AKQA.
