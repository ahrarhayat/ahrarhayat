Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
This is Ahrar Hayat, from Melbourne, Australia! I've graduated from Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Soon after graduation, I started working as a Software tester in my home country Bangladesh. After two years in the industry, I decided to switch my career path to a software developer and started my Masters program at Monash University, Melbourne. I develop applications and APIs in various platforms including Android, AWS, .NET MVC, and Microsoft Azure. I love building apps that people can use to make their quality of lives much better, and my goal is to play a part in contributing to technology everyday.
